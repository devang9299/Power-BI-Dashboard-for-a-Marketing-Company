<p>For the challenge, you will be assuming the role of a newly-hired Bl consultants for Zest Marketing, a small digital marketing agency. Their latest marketing campaigns have underperformed, and they have brought you in to analyze their data and propose a solution.</p>

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check the datatypes of all the columns.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that so many columns were having null, empty and filler values which can be a problem in creating visualizations.
- Step 5 : We started data cleaning, by inserting mean and median values to those null and empty spaces.
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 7 : Since the data contains various ratings, thus in order to represent ratings, a new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 8 : We created 3 different pages to create the dashboards.
- Step 9 : The first page is based on the amount of products consumed in countries according to their incomes with reference to Marital Status.
- Step 10: The second page is based on the purchasing accepted by number of marketing campaign ran according to country with reference to Education.
- Step 11: The third page is based on number of catalog purchases by the count of marital status with reference to education.
